## Technical Challenges and Resolution:

### Understanding and utilizing jQuery for dynamic updates:
The website needed to refresh specific selection menus without refreshing and resetting the whole page. Jquery was used to select and manipulate these objects to build out the compatibility mechanism and input validation in one neat package. Without any previous Jquery experience, this was a time-consuming but ultimately rewarding endeavor.

### Building HTML in VSCode and transferring to Thymeleaf:
Thymeleaf's annotations are unique and confusing at first, especially when transfering over from pure HTML. This took some adjustment, but ultimately the resources found proved sufficient to make the appropriate changes.

### Spring Security Configuration:
Setting up Spring Security can be complex. Ultimately the decision was made to not make a custom login and logout page to focus on more important functions of this project. The configuration required some research, but Spring Security came together quickly after research was complete.

### Junit Test Suite Configuration:
The dependencies and versions were very fragile while setting up a test suite. Ultimately after Eclipse failed to set up a suite that was Junit version 5, the test suit had to be redone manually and dependencies were added with the correct version to get the desired result. This required a frusterating amount of troubleshooting.
